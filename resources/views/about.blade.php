                    <h3>The beginning…</h3>
                What is now WeFix began life in 2012 as Reviveaphone. Developed by Oliver Murphy, Reviveaphone was originally a ground-breaking new product that could be used to repair water-damaged mobile phones.

                    <h3>Into the den…</h3>
                    <p>Encouraged by friends and family, in 2013 Oliver appeared on the hit BBC show Dragons’ Den, looking for investment in his innovative product.</p>
                    <p>The pitch proved popular with The Dragons, and a £50,000 investment was secured.</p>

                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <h3>Taking on the world…</h3>
                    <p>Hugely successful, Reviveaphone was sold across the globe.</p>
                    <p>A further product was brought to market in 2014 – Splash was a water repelling spray that created a barrier around a smartphone, preventing potential water damage.</p>

                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <h3>Prepare to repair…</h3>
                    <p>With the introduction of water-resistant smartphones, Oliver looked for further opportunities, and in 2015 he launched a new repair service under the Reviveaphone banner.</p>
                    <p>Initially, devices were submitted for repair by post, however, in true entrepreneurial style, Oliver wanted the service to stand out from the crowd and so the mobile smartphone repair service that ‘comes to you’ was born.</p>

            <div class="row" >
                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <h3>And then there was WeFix…</h3>
                    <p>The service proved hugely popular, and in 2017 after significant investment, Reviveaphone rebranded, becoming WeFix.</p>
                    <p>Later that year, WeFix entered into a partnership with Samsung to become the tech giant’s only UK manufacturer approved mobile smartphone repairer.</p>
